```

- **Languages I love:** Go for elegant concurrency, and Rust for fearless performance.
- **What Iâ€™m shipping:** self-healing micro-services, edge-deployed LLMs, and event-driven systems that *just keep scaling*.  
- **Stacks I wrangle:** Kubernetes & Docker (turning container chaos into order), AWS (from Lambda to EKS), and a sprinkle of GitOps for zero-drama releases.  
- **How I think:** first-principles, automation-firstâ€”because the best code is the one you never babysit.  
- **Current quest:** shrinking state-of-the-art AI models to run on a Raspberry Pi cluster while sipping single-digit watts.  

> *Code with purpose, deploy with confidence, automate the rest.*

Join me as I explore the frontiers of **Go**, **Rust**, **Kubernetes**, and **applied AI**â€”one commit at a time.
