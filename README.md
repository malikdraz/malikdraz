### Hi there üëãüèª My name is [Malik](https://www.malikdraz.io).

I'm driven by the elegance and performance of [Go](https://go.dev/), I thrive on crafting clean, and efficient Go code. 

When not pushing pixels, I'm knee-deep in [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) clusters, orchestrating containerized chaos into streamlined solutions. I also embrace the flexibility and power of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), always seeking innovative ways to build and deploy scalable applications. 

Whether contributing to open-source projects or tackling complex production issues, my motto is: code with purpose, deploy with confidence. 

Join me on my journey exploring the ever-evolving world of [Go](https://go.dev/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io), and all things containers!
