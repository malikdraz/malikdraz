Hi there 👋🏻 My name is Malik.

I'm driven by the elegance and performance of Go, I thrive on crafting clean, efficient code. 

When not pushing pixels, I'm knee-deep in Kubernetes clusters, orchestrating containerized chaos into streamlined solutions. I also embrace the flexibility and power of Docker, always seeking innovative ways to build and deploy scalable applications. 

Whether contributing to open-source projects or tackling complex production issues, my motto is: code with purpose, deploy with confidence. 

Join me on my journey exploring the ever-evolving world of Go, Kubernetes, and all things containers!
